This repository is designed to document my approach to setting up a basic Home Assistant installation with a connection to Victron Energy devices (solar mppt charge controller, battery smartshunt, inverter etc.)

Many of the settings will require changing for your local configuration so **please read the documentation** before attempting to blindly run a `docker compose up -d`.

For details on what's included in the documentation and planned in the future refer to the [Roadmap](todo.md) or a brief summary below.
