# Project Ra

This repository is designed to document my approach to setting up a basic Home Assistant installation with a connection to Victron Energy devices (solar mppt charge controller, battery smartshunt, inverter etc.)

Many of the settings will require changing for your local configuration so please read the documentation before attempting to blindly run a `docker compose up -d`.

For the full, interactive, documentation see [darth-veitcher.github.io/project-ra/latest](http://darth-veitcher.github.io/project-ra/latest/)
